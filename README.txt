2. What Java version are you using?

3. What IDE are you using?

4. What challenges were you facing?
The client and the server classes initially challenged us to think of ways they would be able to communicate effectively. Thanks to the UML design, however, we had an idea of what classes to use and how to go about the project. The implementation of the code itself was also difficult as we tried to apply a lot of the learning concepts that were taught in class to make sure we had a full understanding of it. Lastly, working as a group forced us to communicate constantly and make sure everyone was in the same boat. To make our implementation a smoother process, we used GitHub to publish our code and provided feedback to each other.
